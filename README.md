# Hi, I am Kaushik Kumar 👋
**Agentic AI / Data & ML Engineer** • MS CS @ NJIT • Open to Work (2026)

I build **production-grade data + ML systems** and **agentic AI copilots** that connect to real tools (databases, filings, APIs) and return **auditable, citation-first** outputs.  
My focus is hands-on: reproducible pipelines, reliable evaluation, and clean architecture you can extend.

### What I work on
- **Agentic AI systems:** single- and multi-agent workflows with tool calling, structured outputs, retries/fallbacks, and safe execution patterns.
- **Orchestration:** graph-based routing (e.g., LangGraph-style), supervisor/critic patterns, and agent-to-agent task decomposition for complex queries.
- **Tooling & integrations:** agents that query real systems (SEC/EDGAR, financial statements, macro data, PDFs, GitHub, databases) and return cited, auditable results.
- **RAG (production-grade):** baseline RAG → agentic RAG → **hybrid retrieval** (keyword + vector), metadata filtering, chunking strategies, and citation-first responses.
- **Memory:** short-term conversation memory + long-term task/user memory with clear “when to remember vs. forget” rules.
- **Evaluation & observability:** automated evals (RAG quality + tool accuracy), tracing, prompt/version tracking, and regression tests for agent behavior.
- **LLM app engineering:** streaming UX, caching, rate-limit handling, cost/latency optimization, and robust error handling.
- **Forecasting + analytics modules:** time-series forecasting and KPI analysis exposed as callable tools with explainable outputs.
- **Reusable templates:** “clone → install → run” starter kits with clean repo structure and reproducible environments.
